Yet another blog...
Great, just what the internet needs, ey?

If you're looking for grumpy rants about software with the ocassional
optimistic message, you're in the right place.
I may post all kinds of other stuff in the future
(maybe about music, whiskey reviews,... I dunno, we'll see),
so apologies in advance.

If you want to be notified when a new article comes up
(which may be tomorrow, in 10 years or never - who knows),
make sure to follow
<a href="https://twitter.com/WDD_blog" target="_blank">@WDD_Blog</a> on twitter.
Maybe I'll make an RSS feed in the future, but for now, this is the only way to get updated.
