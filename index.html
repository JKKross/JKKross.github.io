	<h2>About me</h2>

	<p>
	I am a programmer and a musician based in Prague.
	</p>
	<p>
	I studied classical guitar at <a href="http://www.prgcons.cz/zakladniinformace" target="_blank">Prague Conservatory</a>
	and bass guitar at <a href="https://www.kjj.cz/" target="_blank">Jaroslav Ježek Conservatory</a>.
	After my studies, I started teaching classical & bass guitar at <a href="https://www.zus-vlasim.cz" target=_blank">ZUŠ Vlašim</a>.
	That's when I picked up coding as a hobby. At first, I was only curious about how computers work at a conceptual level,
	but after a few weeks, I discovered programming and got immediately hooked!
	</p>
	<p>
	After learning the basics for a few months, YouTube decided to recommend me
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/seanallen" target="_blank">Sean Allen's Swift & iOS tutorials</a>.
	I already had an iPhone & an iPad and I really liked them, so I decided to give making apps for iOS a try.
	Thanks to my mom, I got my first MacBook Pro, downloaded Xcode
	and started on a path, that brought me to where I am now.
	</p>
	<p>
	I've been programming for 3 years and I'm currently looking for a job in iOS development.
	I would like to join a team that will help me learn and grow - both as a programmer, and as a person.
	If you're looking for a passionate programmer, get in touch with me via	<a href="mailto:zawadski.jkk@gmail.com">email</a>.
